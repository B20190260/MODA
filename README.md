# MODA

## Getting Started

### Preparation 

MODA requires a MATLAB installation. The latest version (R2019a) is recommended but not required.

The following MATLAB toolboxes should be installed:
- Signal Processing Toolbox                
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox  
- Wavelet Toolbox         

You can check which toolboxes are currently installed by running the "ver" command in the MATLAB Command Window.

### Running MODA

To use MODA, download the code and place it in a desired location. In your file explorer, double-click "MODA.m" inside the MODA folder to open it with MATLAB. 

MODA can then be started using the "Run" button in the MATLAB editor.
